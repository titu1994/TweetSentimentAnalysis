3041| 10/17/2012| AM 0:4:32| Someone called my phone and told me to vote for Mitt <e>Romney</e>. & I told him I hope he dies before people start voting.|-1
3042| 10/17/2012| AM 0:7:41| I respect those who believe in <e>Romney</e>, but I don't believe that he will be good <a>for our country</a>.|2
3043| 10/17/2012| AM 0:10:19| I havent heard <a>nothing positive</a> come out of <e>Romney</e>'s mouth #Team<e>Obama</e>|2
3044| 10/17/2012| AM 0:12:35| I bet Mitt <e>Romney</e> prefers Rose Art over Crayola.|0
3045| 10/17/2012| AM 0:20:39| Shut the fuck up <e>Romney</e>!|-1
3046| 10/17/2012| AM 0:21:33| <e>Obama</e> better win the US election, <e>Romney</e> is just<a>annoying</a> me.|2
3047| 10/17/2012| AM 0:23:05| I don't like <e>Obama</e> and I don't like <e>Romney</e> all that much either.|2
3048| 10/17/2012| AM 0:33:21| @thghtlsscmng I hate <e>Romney</e> Ryan.....but Ryan's cute.....I'd bend him over the oval office desk and teach about <a>gay rights</a>!|-1
3049| 10/17/2012| AM 1:9:38| @JoeNBC <e>Romney</e> <a>policy</a> will harm <a>women</a>, make a note.|-1
3050| 10/17/2012| AM 1:18:54| @Morning_Joe # <e>Romney</e> had <a>no strong points</a> last night. You people r hypocrites|-1
3051| 10/17/2012| AM 1:21:50| @ParrJimmy haha oh well <e>Romney</e> sucks|-1
3052| 10/17/2012| AM 1:21:54| I am going to <a>vote for</a> <e>Romney</e> for the same reasons people voted for #<e>Obama</e> four years ago!|2
3053| 10/17/2012| AM 1:26:10| <e>Romney</e> is such a fucking <a>liar</a> I am convinced that people who want to vote for him are undercover racists.|-1
3054| 10/17/2012| AM 2:10:37| The real question on America's mind is what size binder does <e>Romney</e> prefer?|-1
3055| 10/17/2012| AM 3:24:00| I do not like Mitt <e>Romney</e>|-1
3056| 10/17/2012| AM 5:7:16| I dont necessarily agree w everything #<e>Romney</e> says but overall the big picture is his attempt to <a>stimulate the economy</a> will most likely work|2
3057| 10/17/2012| AM 6:2:26| No one trusts Mitt <e>Romney</e> until he says he's <a>cutting education and Planned Parenthood</a>. Then, he becomes the most honest man in the world.|-1
3058| 10/17/2012| AM 6:13:09| <e>Romney</e> is a TRUE dumbass.. #SorryNOTSorry .|-1
3059| 10/17/2012| AM 6:20:22| @caitlinelleee <e>Romney</e>'s a douche. Simply put.|-1
3060| 10/17/2012| AM 6:48:22| The<a>Libya situation</a>would have been huge for <e>Romney</e> and candy took away the opportunity for him to speak on that...|1
3061| 10/17/2012| AM 7:8:04| Folks who plan to vote 4  <e>Romney</e> better wake up!!!! #debate #gonnagetblindsided #liar #cheater #GREEDY|-1
3062| 10/17/2012| AM 7:39:08| @ClemsonCraig21 <e>Romney</e> hasn't ever gone in <a>depth about his plan</a>. He never has specifics. That 8% would only give him time to repeat himself|-1
3063| 10/17/2012| AM 7:41:54| It's time to stand up and fight for America. President <e>Obama</e>'s change wasn't sufficient. Vote @Mitt<e>Romney</e> @PaulRyanVP #AmericasComebackTeam|2
3064| 10/17/2012| AM 7:44:49| I love how <e>Romney</e>'s idea of making a family friendly work/life arrangement is <a>letting them leave work at five</a>. Gee thanks, that's swell.|1
3065| 10/17/2012| AM 8:5:31| It's amazing to me that <e>Romney</e> couldn't even win on the <a>Libya question</a>.|-1
3066| 10/17/2012| AM 8:16:26| @TheTweetOfGod Mitt <e>Romney</e> said we are all your children, but you love me best right?|0
3067| 10/17/2012| AM 8:18:31| Dear Mr. <e>Romney</e>, Your <a>sexism</a> is showing. My mom WAS a single mom. To date, I haven't robbed, raped or killed anyone. You, sir, are an ass.|-1
3068| 10/17/2012| AM 8:21:44| #<e>Romney</e> Lol this man is sick. If he wins it's all because of <a>race</a>. Listen and learn dumb dora's and diego's.|-1
3069| 10/17/2012| AM 8:24:14| Governor <e>Romney</e> said govt. does not <a>create jobs</a>.that means those looking for jobs should not expect to find one if he is elected president.|-1
3070| 10/17/2012| AM 9:0:25| <e>Romney</e> is only for the <a>rich</a>|-1

3074| 10/17/2012| AM 9:36:13| If <e>Romney</e> cared about <a>family over profits</a>: pay women equally, realize both genders do housework , realize some families theres no mom.|-1
3075| 10/17/2012| AM 9:44:27| <e>Romney</e> came off as arrogant, controlling and disrespectful in this debate.|-1
3076| 10/17/2012| AM 9:57:11| Catching up on last night's debate. <e>Romney</e> is smooth but poor <a>on detail</a>. <e>Obama</e> is coming across well, with <a>passion and vision</a>.|2

3080| 10/17/2012| AM 10:45:07| @BillyBluntBlowr <e>Romney</e> is an idiot and a sorry excuse for a politician, republican candidate, and gives a bad name for anyone white|-1

3092| 10/17/2012| PM 1:6:34| @wxyzdetroit <e>Romney</e> <a>won</a> the debate, maybe the news media should be a little more neutral and HONEST about what is happening in the U.S.A.!|1
3093| 10/17/2012| PM 1:17:45| @JksTinkylicious @WhoopiGoldberg <e>Romney</e> was fighting for his right to <a>lie</a> |-1
3094| 10/17/2012| PM 1:21:23| #<e>Obama</e> and #<e>Romney</e> in 2nd debate should have put some gloves on and go at it they know they wanted to haha ??|2

3101| 10/17/2012| PM 3:41:31| @carolcnn it seems like Republicans are just blaming the moderator because they know <e>Romney</e> lost. #poorsports.|-1

3150| 10/17/2012| AM 6:8:34| <e>Romney</e> think we all can just go <a>ask our parents for 30k for college</a>. Not everyone was born rich like you|-1

3153| 10/17/2012| AM 6:12:26| <e>Romney</e>...you can't continue to say that <a>something will work because it  worked in Massachusetts</a>. That state makes up 2% of the population.|-1
3154| 10/17/2012| AM 6:13:28| <e>Romney</e>'s <a>first major victory</a> occurred on June 6th 1944 where he single handedly claimed the beach of Normandy.|-1
3155| 10/17/2012| AM 6:14:01| <e>Romney</e>'s <a>five-point plan</a> is a one point plan. Like about everything.|-1
